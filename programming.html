        <h2>WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?</h2>
        <P class="Paragraph">Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written using programming languages.</P><br>
        <h2>WHY PROGRAMMING IS IMPORTANT?</h2>
        <P class="Paragraph">Programming helps in problem solving, automation, and software development.
            It is an essential tool for computer science students.
        </P><br>
        <h2>TYPES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>High Level Language</li>
            <li>Low Level Language</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE</h3>
        <P class="Paragraph">These are designed to be user-oriented. They use English-like words which makes them easy for us to read and write.
            They are very easy to learn and debug.
        </P>

        <h3>LOW LEVEL LANGUAGE</h3>
        <P class="Paragraph">These are machine-oriented. 
            They deal directly with the computer's physical components like memory addresses and registers. 
            There are two types of Low Level Languages.</P>
            <ul>
                <li>Machine Language</li>
                <li>Assembly Language</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Machine Language</h4>
        <P class="Paragraph">This is the lowest level of programming language. 
            It is the only language that the computer's processor (CPU) can understand directly without any translation.
            It consists entirely of binary code (0s and 1s).</P>
        <h4>Assembly Language</h4>
        <P class="Paragraph">This is a small step up from machine code. 
            It replaces the confusing strings of 1s and 0s with short, English-like "nicknames" called mnemonics.</P><br>
